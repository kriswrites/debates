# Circular Reasoning (Begging the Question)

## Definition:
Circular reasoning is a logical fallacy where the conclusion of an argument is assumed in the premises. This type of reasoning does not provide any actual evidence for the claim, as it essentially restates the argument in different words, leading to no new information or insight.

In other words, the argument's premises and conclusion are essentially the same, which makes the reasoning "circular."

## Example:
**Argument**: "The Bible is the word of God because it says so in the Bible."

In this example, the premise that "The Bible is the word of God" is supported by the claim that "it says so in the Bible." However, this doesn't offer independent evidence; it's merely a repetition of the original claim.

## How to Spot It:
- Look for arguments where the conclusion is just a restatement of the premise.
- The argument doesn't provide new or external evidence; it simply refers back to the original statement.
- Often seen in religious or philosophical arguments where faith-based beliefs are presented as evidence for the same beliefs.

## Why It's a Fallacy:
Circular reasoning fails to support its conclusion with any independent or external evidence. It assumes what it sets out to prove, making it logically invalid. For an argument to be persuasive, it must offer evidence that isn't simply a repetition of the claim itself.

## Common Variations:
- **Petitio Principii**: A broader term for circular reasoning that applies to situations where the argument assumes the conclusion within the premises.
- **Tautology**: In some cases, circular reasoning may involve repeating an idea in a way that doesnâ€™t contribute to understanding or proving it.

## How to Avoid It:
- Ensure that your premises provide independent support for your conclusion.
- Avoid restating your conclusion in a different way within the premises.
- Use evidence or reasoning that does not assume the truth of the conclusion.

## Related Fallacies:
- **Ad Hominem**: Sometimes circular reasoning is used in conjunction with personal attacks to distract from the main argument.
- **Straw Man**: This fallacy can be part of a misrepresentation where the original argument is reformulated to make it easier to attack.
